        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>At TideTech Solutions, our journey is one of passion, growth, and rediscovery. It all began with a deep love for technology. 
            With a background in IT studies, I initially dived into the world of tech, eager to create, build, and innovate. However, life had other plans, 
            and I found myself stepping into the world of IT sales—a move that changed everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            For six incredible years, I thrived in sales, honing my skills in communication, problem-solving, 
            and understanding the needs of businesses. This experience gave me a unique perspective on what 
            clients truly want: solutions that not only work but drive results. 
            While I found success in sales, my heart never strayed far from the creative side of technology—specifically, web development.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now, I’m combining the best of both worlds. At TideTech Solutions, I bring the technical expertise of an IT professional, 
            the business acumen of a seasoned sales expert, and the passion of a developer eager to build websites that help businesses grow. 
            I’ve rediscovered my love for web development and am dedicated to creating solutions that are as functional as they are beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
            Our mission is simple: to provide businesses with websites that not only meet their needs but exceed their expectations. 
            From design to deployment, I’m here to help your business make its mark in the digital world.</p>
